# How to use this repo:

The files in this directory should be cloned into `$HOME/.files` or someplace
similar.  Hardlinks should then be made between these files and their
counterparts in `$HOME`. The script `link.sh` can take care of these links
(and tell you what changes would be made).

Each machine using this repo should have its own branch.  There is a special
branch `base` which is the parent of the other branches.
